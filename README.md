# Gustavo's Employee Payroll Tracker


##  Usert Story
In this challnge our goal was to fix/ refactor the existing JavaScript Code to allow the user to be able to add inofrmation about his or her employees. The entered information included the first and last name as well as the salary of the entered employee.

When entering more than one employee, the user should also then be able to inspect the console and be able to see not only the average salary of all of the entered employees but also be able to have a random employee selected as a winner.

## Changes
As far as any refactoring done to the code, the only section that was to be changed was the scrip.js (javaScript) as well as changing the source in the HTML to be able to link the CSS and the JavaScript to our HTML.

## Tests
A lot of my tests conssisted on trial and error. When i would write my intended code i would first save and refresh the Live Opened Server to check for any undefined errors in the console. When said error was found, I would then go back to my scrip.js to target the error and see posible solutions through the  provided resources in lectures, READ.md, slack-channel-03resources, and online research, I was able to solve the problem and find possible solutions. Once a solution(s) was found, i tested see if the problem was fixed both on the console and on the interface.
